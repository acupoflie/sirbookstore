        "description": "Notes from Underground is a novella written by Russian author Fyodor Dostoevsky, first published in 1864. The work is considered one of the earliest existentialist novels and is often cited as a precursor to the development of modern psychological literature. The novella is presented in two parts: the first being a philosophical and introspective monologue by an unnamed, alienated narrator living in St. Petersburg, and the second featuring a more narrative-driven account of events from his past. The Underground Man, as the protagonist is often referred to, is a highly intellectual and self-aware individual who grapples with his own contradictions, bitterness, and a sense of societal alienation. He explores themes such as free will, consciousness, and the nature of human existence, offering a critical examination of both rationalism and utopian ideals. The novella is celebrated for its deep psychological insight, complex narrative structure, and its exploration of the darker aspects of human nature.",
